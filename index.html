      <h2> Automotive Journalist, Photographer, Videographer, etc. </h2>

    <p>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While it's not my favorite topic, I suppose every journalist at some point will need to write about themselves.
          I guess this is that dreaded moment. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I'm not sure exactly how to start describing myself.  Definitely my best trait is determination and the will to learn anything
        I put my mind to.  I taught myself photography and videography and honed my writing skills by doing a variety of articles for a small magazine
        in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.  My mentor and editor Robin Jay really was the reason I got into journalism.  Seeing my articles published
        was just like another passion of mine: welding.  Yes, really, welding.  <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Early on in my college career, I thought I wanted to get a degree in mechanical engineering.  A lifelong
        gearhead and car nut, this made sense.  After taking some courses at FAU however, I learned that engineering was far too theoretical
        and not nearly hands on enough.  After some odd jobs like an IT migration project for Broward County, installing car stereos, and starting
        and closing a business in home theater manufacturing, I decided it was time to learn a trade.  I'd always wanted to learn to weld, so
        I started at PBCC and excelled in welding.  It was an amazing feeling creating something from basically nothing. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's where journalism comes in for me.  It gives me a similar sense of accomplishment creating and
        crafting an article and seeing it through to print.  It's quite a bit safer than welding, as I've not set myself on fire while writing, but have
        quite a few times from welding.  <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Admittedly I'm a former computer nerd.  Maybe I still am.  The University of Miami has given me an even more comprehensive
        set of tools to work with, namely almost the entire Adobe suite of products, from Illustrator to Photoshop and beyond.  I've also honed my analytic skills
        in classes like data journalism and web design.  My goal was to have as diverse of a skillset as possible.  <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I couldn't do this without my loving wife Emily, who has pushed me to better myself in everything
        I do, whether it's cars, networking, or even college.  If you check out my resume, you'll see that I'm far from the typical
        college senior.  Take a look, learn, and most of all check out my portfolio for some published work that I'm quite proud of. Last, but certainly not least, check out <a href="http://www.blogofspeed.com">Blog of Speed</a>, my website about all things car reltaed.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enjoy,<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Josh <br></strong>
